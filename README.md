### Google Local Challenge
The dataset used contains reviews about businesses from Google Local (Google Maps). The data includes geographic information for each business as well as its reviews. I worked with team members Timothy Lee and Aiden Yoon to develop a recommender system during the Datathon. Our project won first place for the Google Local Challenge out of 10 groups that participated.
